## A note on adapting this repository to your own personal website

Many people have contacted me about adapting this website. I have tried to make things as simple as possible. There are still bugs. I am sorry. If you find a bug, please email me (tmuzanenhamo14@gmail.com) or submit an issue or a pull request

## Dependencies

Tested with:

node >= v8, v9, v10, v11
Recommend nvm for managing node version

## Set up
You may wish to fork this repository or remove my remote origin and add your own. Go here for more information on changing remotes.

To download the repository and install dependencies, run the following commands:

cd mywebsite
npm install
If you do not have yarn installed, you may run npm install instead.

Next, you should create a .env file. To do this, run:

cp sample.env .env
and set values as appropriate. Most people will not need to make changes.

Run the following command to build the react application and serve it with hot module reloading:

npm run dev
Navigate to <ip>:<port> default: http://localhost:3000 to view my website.

This completes set up instructions. Please continue reading to learn how to modify this site to make it your own.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
