        "bios":"Facing the crossroads of different career paths, in several different fields I was passionate about, was the most impossible task I've had to do. I was that guy, in school, who got so into it during History class debates, that I would yell \"Objection!!\" before going full Harvey Specter on people, and yet would, for instance, do completely different experiments from everyone else during Science class because I found investigating the workings of the world something incredibly fascinating. Engineering became a perfect fit for me when I realised that I could bring everything that I am to my work in this field: my love for Art, Mathematics, Physics, Anatomy, Programming and so forth. This choice was further fostered by my experiences doing outreaches to different communities during my gap year, which gave me a better perspective on how I can marry innovation and the betterment of life for mankind. I believe going down this path will allow me to make a significant impact on the world and live for something more than just myself.",
        "bio": "Hailing from a family where the importance of education and holistic development has always been underscored,since childhood, I have always been a diligent and committed student who burns the midnight oil in the quest for excellence in all my endeavors.  Being ambitious, I toiled hard to be among the high-flyers of my high school and simultaneously I participated in many extracurricular activities to back up my self-confidence, improve my experience in different working fields and to allow me to exploit my versatility to the hilt. Currently, I am in my Final Year reading a bachelor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the prestigious University of Cape Town in South Africa. Ambitious and Socially Confident as I have always been, I like extending my help to those in need and love to interact with the people from different backgrounds and cultures."
